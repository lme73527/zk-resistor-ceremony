# ZKResistor trusted setup ceremony

Multi-party setup for the two BLS12-381 Groth16 circuits used by [ZKResistor](https://github.com/TONresistor/zk-resistor-contracts). Anyone is welcome to contribute.

> **Phase 1 closes 2026-06-20 16:00 UTC.** Contribute before then to be included in it.

## Why

A Groth16 circuit needs a trusted setup. Such a setup is sound as long as one contributor honestly destroys their entropy. A solo setup forces every user to trust that one person; a multi-party setup makes collusion the only attack, and collusion gets harder with every participant.

## Two phases

The setup runs in two parts, in order:

- **Phase 1**, the BLS12-381 powers of tau (power 16). Universal, circuit-independent. There is no public BLS12-381 powers of tau to reuse, so this ceremony generates its own.
- **Phase 2**, the per-circuit keys for `insert` and `withdraw`, derived from the phase-1 output.

Each phase is its own contribution chain, needs at least one honest contributor of its own, and closes with a [Drand](https://drand.love) beacon.

## Contributing

Fork, run one script in Docker, open a PR. `scripts/contribute.sh` contributes to whichever phase is open. Full steps in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Final beacon

Each phase closes with a future Drand round applied as the final mixing step. The round is posted here before it happens, so its value is unpredictable to everyone, including the coordinator, at commit time.

- **Phase 1** closes at Drand round **6218006** (League of Entropy mainnet), **2026-06-20 16:00 UTC**.
- **Phase 2**: announced here before it closes.
